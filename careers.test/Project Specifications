Description:
The Selenium Framework includes Cucumber BDD, TestNG, and JUnit libraries that control the test executions.
The Cucumber feature file lists the scenarios and test steps that are glued to the StepDefinition class.
The CustomListeners file contains methods that should get invoked when a specific event happens, currently only configured for a test failure in a specific test case.
Through the TestRunner file, we can control which types of tests to run, like Smoke/Sanity/Regression.
